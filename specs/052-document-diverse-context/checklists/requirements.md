# Specification Quality Checklist: Document-Diverse Retrieval Context

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-27  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond constitution-required architecture boundaries
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders where possible
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] UI tasks captured for user-facing features (not applicable; backend retrieval behavior only)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where possible
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No unnecessary implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Approved scope is limited to final prompt context selection. Broader intent classification, chunking changes, embedding weighting, answer voice, and citation presentation remain out of scope.
